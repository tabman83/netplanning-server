netplanning-server
==================

The NetPlanning server and API to support the NetPlanning client application.


Architecture
------------

Every 30 minutes (configurable) the server connects with the NetPlanning websites and downloads the entire user planning.
The downloaded planning is then compared to the local stored one and the following scenario can happen:
- Remote planning is the same of the local one: processing stops here. Timer is reset, for new update to occur in 30 minutes.
- Remote planning is different from the local one: changes are collected and stored in a separate table for changes only. 
Local data is updated accordingly. A push notifications is issued to all the registed clients.

The client application also has the option to trigger a new download of the planning. An update button will issue an update invokation to the server that will in turn immediately reset its timer and download the planning. The update API will reply with a code telling whether a change in the planning is available or not.

Following are the endpoints exposed by the server.

- ```GET /items``` gets a list of the planning for the calling user, as it was returned by the latest download from the NetPlanning website; a timestamp is also returned in the header to inform the end user of when the last check occurred
- ```DELETE /items/(id)``` cancels the specified lesson/availability
- ```GET /changes``` gets the history of the changes to the planning for the calling user
- ```DELETE /changes``` clears the history of the changes
- ```POST /update``` forces the update of the planning for the calling user
- ```POST /login``` logs the user in
